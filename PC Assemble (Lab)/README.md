Reflection on PC Assemble (Lab)

During the PC assembly lab, I acquired practical knowledge of computer hardware through hands-on experience. The session comprised a systematic guide for constructing a PC. Working together with my peers in a group environment, we actively participated in the assembly process. This hands-on activity offered me valuable insights into the complexities of hardware components, improving my comprehension of PC construction. By the session's conclusion, the components that were initially disassembled had seamlessly come together to form a functional computer.
